We spent a lot of time on our tokenizer, and didn't have that much time to make the flowers. Our greatest challenge was making the tokeniezer detect flower names, as we had first made a flawed system. This system used a for loop to loop through each charecter in the input, and didn't work. It kept getting more complex, until we decided to entirely replace it with another system that checked each word instead. This worked much better.
